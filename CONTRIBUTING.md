# Contributing


Thank you for your interest in contributing — we appreciate it! This document explains how to contribute in ways that make it easier for maintainers to review and accept your contributions.


## Ways to contribute


- Open an issue to discuss ideas before writing large changes.
- Submit a pull request (PR) for bug fixes, enhancements, documentation, or translations.
- Help triage issues by labeling, leaving reproduction steps, or suggesting a solution.


## Before you submit


1. Search existing issues and PRs — your change may already be discussed.
2. Add the `hacktoberfest` label to issues that are intended for Hacktoberfest contributors (maintainers should do this).
3. Make sure your change is focused and small. Large, multi-purpose PRs are harder to review.


## Development workflow


- Fork the repository.
- Create branch: `git checkout -b fix/my-descriptive-branch`.
- Keep commits focused and with descriptive commit messages.
- Rebase or merge the latest `main` before opening a PR.


## Pull request checklist


- [ ] The PR has a clear title and description of what it changes.
- [ ] The PR references related issue(s) (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- [ ] Tests added or updated where appropriate.
- [ ] `npm test` / `make test` / CI passes.
- [ ] The PR is small and self-contained.


## Code style


Follow the existing code style in the project. If ESLint, Prettier, or equivalent tools exist, run them before opening a PR.


## Reviews & merging


- Be patient — maintainers will review as soon as possible.
- We accept valid contributions by merging, approving, or by adding the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label for Hacktoberfest contributions.


## If your PR is closed


If your PR is closed with feedback, please read the maintainer’s comments and feel free to open a follow-up PR that addresses them.


## Security issues


Report security issues privately to the maintainers via email (add maintainer email here) rather than opening a public issue.
